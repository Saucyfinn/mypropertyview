## üì± **iOS App Setup (Optional)**

The iOS components exist but need additional work to be fully functional. For now, **focus on the enhanced web app** which has all the key features working.

**If you want to work on iOS later:**
- The Swift files are in `PropertyView-Enhanced/PropertyView/PropertyView-Enhanced/`
- You'll need to create an Xcode project and add these files
- Additional AR managers need to be integrated from the original project
